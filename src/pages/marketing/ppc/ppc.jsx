                Today, the digital landscape keeps growing and websites are
                proliferating at warp speed. From small companies and franchises

                <br />
                <br />
                Despite the availability of advertising tools and digital
                marketing channels, some businesses remain invisible to their
                target audience. As a result, market players are in an uphill
                battle, barely making progress with their internet marketing
                efforts.
                <br />
                <br />
                PPC stands for pay-per-click, a model of digital advertising
                where the advertiser pays a fee each time one of their ads is
                clicked.

                A Hanapin Marketing report shows that 79 percent of marketers
                find paid search marketing beneficial to their business.
                Consequently, approximately 62 percent of industry players said
                they would continue to increase their PPC ads budget in the
                coming years to draw new customers looking for their services.

                <br />
                According to Social Media Today, more than 7 million advertisers
                spent a total of $10.01 billion for pay per click ads in 2017
                alone. Evidently, pay per click has become one of the most
                widely used marketing frameworks for generating higher ROI. But
                what is pay per click and how can it ramp up your digital
                marketing efforts?
