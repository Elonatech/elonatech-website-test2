                <br /> Brand identity is the visible elements of a brand, such
                as color, design, and logo, that identify and distinguish the
                brand in consumers' minds. Brand identity is distinct from brand
                image. It corresponds to the intent behind the branding and the
                way a company does it, all to cultivate a certain image in
                consumers' minds. It’s much more than a logo, Elonatech brand

                Brand identity matters because without it, customers are not

                        A brand is essentially the personality and identity of
                        your business. It is what forms the first impression of
                        your business for potential customers and encompasses
                        how it looks and sounds. It is how the market identifies
                        your business compared to your competitors and will
                        hopefully make you stand out. Components of a brand can

                      Branding is the process of creating a brand. It is
                      important as it involves clearly positioning your company
                      or product in the market, devising a brand strategy,
                      possibly creating your name, defining your company’s tone
                      of voice and designing corporate and/or product identity.
                      Using water as an example, how do several companies around
                      the world sell the same product and convince the market to
                      purchase their water over their competitors? The simple
                      answer: a great brand!

                      We need to get one thing straight, a brand is much more
                      than a logo! Whilst we understand cost can be a
                      determining factor and we certainly appreciate the desire
                      to get a visual representation for your business quickly,
                      we just don’t believe logos alone tell enough of a story
                      about your business. A poorly designed logo can end up
                      targeting the wrong market altogether. <br />
                      <br />
                      We believe a brand speaks volumes about a business,

                        </li>
                        <li>
                          How a business understands their target markets by

                      Your brand describes who you are and what you do,
                      therefore it is important your visual identity – your
                      logo, which is utilised for virtually all of your
                      marketing communications, clearly communicates this.

                      Ummm….no! Remember, a brand is much more than just a logo.
                      It is the story, look and voice of a brand. <br />
                      A high quality branding process involves market research
                      including target markets and competitors, and
                      understanding your industry, checking if trade names and
                      domains are available, creating a mood board, testing
                      color schemes in different environments, creating a unique
                      logo that is memorable and finding fonts & typography that
                      is effective…the list goes on! Our branding workshops are
                      also a fabulous way for businesses to really clarify who
                      and what you are and who your target market is. <br />
                      Branding can be a lengthy process which may involve
                      several creative people working on the project and it
                      requires input and collaboration with the client. It is
                      also important that the brand is unique in the market to
                      avoid any trademark or copyright legal problems. <br />
                      So, if you put all this in perspective, you can see how
                      getting a logo for #5000 on Fiverr, won’t really provide
                      the full brand story for your business.

                      A successful brand pays attention to their market, will
                      come up with new ways to keep the interest of their target
                      market and are not afraid to innovate. <br /> <br />
                      Apple does this really well through their innovative
                      technology products and fulfilling customers’ needs over
                      time. This can also be evident in the evolution of their
                      brand – the Apple came from their initial logo with Isaac
                      Newton and an Apple above his head. It evolved into an
                      apple with a bite (or byte as Steve Jobs would say),
                      followed by the different variations of the apple relevant
                      to that specific time <br /> <br />
                      Before iPhones and iPads, Nokia was once a major player in
                      the telecoms and technologies industries however did not
                      hold their position as market leaders as they failed to
                      keep their brand and business offerings relevant to market
                      needs. Nokia had the best team of hardware engineers
                      however overlooked the shift from hardware to software and
                      did not make any changes to their brand or marketing.
                      Hence, companies such as Apple & Samsung were able to take
                      Nokia’s place as market leaders in a short timespan.{" "}
