              <p>
                A client knows they’ve got a business problem (such as declining
                revenue or a new competitor in their market). They turn to a
                consultant for help getting to the root of the problem, as a
                sick patient would turn to a doctor.

              <h5 className="mt-2 fw-bold">Diagnosis</h5>
              <p>
                The consultant assesses the client’s business performance,
                taking into account similar problems they’ve seen at clients in
                the past, like a doctor would check their patient’s symptoms
                against known illnesses.

                The consultant provides the client with a step-by-step process
                to improve their business results, much like a doctor provides a
                patient with the steps necessary to regain their health.

                The consultant recommends a course of action to improve revenues
                or meet a competitive threat, much like a doctor would tell
                their patient what’s wrong with them and prescribe medicine or
                recommend a medical procedure.
