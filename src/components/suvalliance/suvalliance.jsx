What Makes a Video Surveillance System?
A video surveillance system / CCTV is composed of a system of cameras, monitors/display units, and recorders. Cameras may be either analog or digital with a host of possible design features which will be discussed momentarily.

These systems can be applied to both interior and exterior areas of a building or property. They can operate 24/7, can be designed to only record in response to movement, or set to record during specific times of the day.

                A video surveillance system / CCTV is composed of a system of
                cameras, monitors/display units, and recorders. Cameras may be
                either analog or digital with a host of possible design features
                which will be discussed momentarily.
                <br />
                <br />
                These systems can be applied to both interior and exterior areas
                of a building or property. They can operate 24/7, can be
                designed to only record in response to movement, or set to
                record during specific times of the day.
                <br />
                <br />
                The cameras may be conspicuous and out in the open to deter
                crime, or they can be more hidden and discreet to record
                evidence with fewer chances of being tampered with. However, it
                is essential to note that laws regulate the placement of
                security cameras within the workplace. These laws vary from
                state to state, so be sure to contact your state’s labor agency
                to learn what your restrictions are.
                <br />
                <br />
                Footage can be monitored live by a security guard, monitored
                remotely if using an IP camera and system (more on that in a
                moment) by a monitoring company, or can simply be recorded and
                stored by a DVR (digital video recorder) or NVR (network video
                recorder) for review later should the need arise.
                <br />
                <br />
                Finally, video surveillance systems are closed – this means its
                signals are not broadcast so that others could intercept and
                view the content. Only authorized users can access the recorded
                material.

                      Yes. While the battery life varies based on camera
                      placement, usage and settings, there are several ways to
                      help extend your battery life between charges. Visit the
                      Camera Settings in your SimpliSafe app and adjust the
                      following settings: Motion Type - set to People Only.
                      Night Vision Mode - set to Standard. This is the default
                      setting. Setup Activity Zones - Remove high traffic areas
                      such as roads, paths and sidewalks etc.
